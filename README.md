# Pizza Shop Project

## Packages/Libraries used
For this project I used Vite platform with REACT. I chose Vite as it is an agnostic platform which support React. The benefits of using Vite as supposed to CRA (Create React App) is that CRA can have performance issues as the application grows in size and complexity, making it potentially problematic for production. Vite also has improved page load perfomances and quicker build times. 


#### Getting Started
The following are the platforms and libraries used:
* npm install react-router-dom --> (for our React routing)
* npm install bootstrap --> (for styling the web application)
* npm install react-bootstrap --> (makes it easier to work with bootstrap in React)

Please cd into Ooni_Trial_Pizza(Samuel_Serrano_Ferraro) and run "npm i" followed by "npm run dev" in order to view the application
